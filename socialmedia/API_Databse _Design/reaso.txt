Reason for Choosing the Social Media API Project
The decision to develop a Social Media API stemmed from my keen interest in understanding how modern web applications function, especially those that facilitate user interaction and content sharing. Social media platforms are an integral part of todayâ€™s digital landscape, and they provide a rich area for exploration in terms of user engagement, data management, and real-time communication. Developing an API for such a platform offered the opportunity to:

Enhance Technical Skills: Building a comprehensive API using Django and Django REST Framework allowed me to deepen my understanding of web development principles, RESTful architecture, and API design.

Learn About User Interactions: Understanding the complexities of user interactions, such as posting content, liking, commenting, and messaging, was crucial for grasping how social media applications operate.

Address Real-World Needs: Social media applications require efficient data handling, privacy considerations, and user authentication. Developing an API that handles these elements offered practical experience in addressing real-world problems.

Project Specifications
Core Features
The Social Media API will include the following core features:

User Management

User registration and authentication using JWT.
User profile management with customizable fields (bio, avatar, location, website).
Post Management

CRUD operations for posts, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete their content.
Support for media uploads (images and videos) with posts.
Likes and Comments

Functionality for users to like and comment on posts, with corresponding counts updated in the post model.
Direct Messaging

Private messaging system where users can send and receive messages, including functionalities for viewing, deleting, and marking messages as read.
Follow System

Allow users to follow/unfollow each other, with features to view followers and following lists.
Hashtags and Notifications

Implement a system for hashtags, enabling users to tag posts and retrieve posts by hashtags.
Notification system to inform users of interactions, such as likes and comments on their posts.
Technical Specifications
Framework: Django with Django REST Framework.
Database: PostgreSQL (for handling relationships and complex queries).
Authentication: JWT for secure user sessions.
Media Storage: Amazon S3 for storing media uploads.
Development Tools: Postman for API testing, dbdiagram.io for database design visualization.
Project Planning
Timeline
The project will be executed over the course of 8 weeks, with each phase focusing on specific aspects of the API development:

Week 1-2: Requirement Analysis and Design

Define detailed project specifications and user stories.
Design the database schema and establish relationships.
Week 3: Setting Up the Environment

Set up the Django project structure and configure settings.
Install required packages and set up a version control system (Git).
Week 4-5: Core Feature Development

Implement user management features.
Develop post management, likes, and comments functionality.
Week 6: Direct Messaging and Notification System

Build the messaging feature for private communication.
Implement a notification system for user interactions.
Week 7: Testing and Debugging

Conduct thorough testing of all API endpoints using Postman.
Debug and resolve any identified issues.
Week 8: Finalization and Documentation

Finalize all features and conduct performance optimization.
Prepare project documentation, including API documentation and user guides.
Conclusion
The Social Media API project provides an exciting opportunity to apply and enhance my technical skills while addressing real-world needs. By following a structured project plan and focusing on core functionalities, I aim to create a robust and scalable API that facilitates user interaction in a social media context. This project will serve as a strong foundation for future endeavors in web development and API design.
