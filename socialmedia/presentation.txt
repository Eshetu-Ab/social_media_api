    Development Process
        -Setting Up the Environment
        -Clone the repository
        -Set up a virtual environment
        -Install dependencies using requirements.txt
        -Building the API
        -Define models for Users, Posts, Comments, Likes, etc.
        -Create serializers for data validation and transformation.
        -Implement viewsets and routes for CRUD operations.
    Testing the API
        -Use Postman or cURL to:
